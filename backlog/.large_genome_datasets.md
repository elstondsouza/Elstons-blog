There have been exponential increases in the amount of data available. However the primary hurdle we all face before entering the era of precision and personalized medicine is the thorough and *accurate analysis* behind this data. Still, even before we aim to delve into these datasets it is clearly important that we take a step back and attempt to analyze our data careful.
