It is simply no secret that the current COVID-19 epidemic has caused, at least at the time of writing, thousands of deaths, millions of isolated individuals and billions of dollars lost economically. However, at least in my view, the societal response to this epidemic has been nothing like in recent memory.

Here in Melbourne, we are admist a shutdown of *all on-essential services* and many business have put measures in place to work from home. 


However, in looking at the recent **media coverage** has facinated me in two folds.

1. The quite aggregious and severely inconsistent use of plots.
2. The lack out outcry from the scientific community regarding this.

## Why is are plots useful?

Health authorities are primarily concerned with the number of active infections. 

In the grand scheme of things, a time-series plot displaying the number of active infection at a given moment in time is vastly more informative on the current dangers and status of an outbreak than any cumulative plot. 


## Cumulative vs. Time-Series plot. 

Okay, so we have misconstrued. 

## Wait, but how do you then tell them apart? 



$$F_X(t) = \int_{0}^{t} f(x) dx$$
