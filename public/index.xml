All of us have been waiting for that solace from the various drugs and vaccines that have been heralded in the news.&#xA;Just recently the AstraZeneca vaccine, one of the forefront and most promising efforts, has been put on hold after a reported case of an adverse reaction.</description>

      <description>Most small businesses around this time have started opening up again and have been looking into the different opportunities to gain their audiences back. Does marketing make sense right now? When is the right time to resume advertising and how do you go about it?&#xA;What does history tell us? Many companies that have looked past that have disregarded advertising during recessions and epidemics have been thrust to the wayside. If history has taught us anything - those who remain proactive during a crisis are often the ones who come out on top.</description>

      <description>We are amidst challenging times where social distancing has stunted many business&amp;rsquo; growth. While in other times, the digital space was primarily used to complement a physical presence as a lead generation mechanism, the current situation has afforded a new opportunity to enter the digital space. The beauty of digital is in the fact that virtual interactions with your customer may completely replace existing physical interactions.&#xA;Despite the allure of a setting up shop completely virtual, there are so many ways to get it wrong.</description>

      <description>Hi! I am Elston.&#xA;I currently work at the Computational Rare Disease Genomics Lab (under Dr. Nicky Whiffin) at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the Center for Population Genomics (under Dr. Daniel MacArthur) based out of the Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rsquo;s Research Institute and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.&#xA;My current research looks at estimating how evolution act on non-coding mutations (a certain kind of mutation that appears in everyone&amp;rsquo;s DNA) and better understand how (and if) they lead to medical disorders in people to help clinicians make accurate genetic diagnoses.</description>

      <title>Ushering the future of psychiatric research with optogenetics</title>

      <description>Rene Decartes, once said that the mind exists separate from the body back in the 16th century. This may be why psychiatric disorders are among the most difficult to both diagnose and to treat. Many other disorders can usually be tested or imaged, whilst most psychiatric conditions still rely on individual consultations rather than examining the brain directly. To allow for a better understanding of the brain’s circuitry especially when disrupted during psychiatric disorders, Francis Crick - one of the founders of the structure of the DNA molecule suggested that neuroscience needed to have a switch that could turn specific neurons on or off.</description>
