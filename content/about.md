Hi! I am Elston.

I currently work at the Computational Rare Disease Genomics Lab (under Dr. Nicky Whiffin) at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the Center for Population Genomics (under Dr. Daniel MacArthur) based out of the Murdoch's Children's Research Institute and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. 

My current research looks at estimating how evolution act on non-coding mutations (a certain kind of mutation that appears in everyone's DNA) and better understand how (and if) they lead to medical disorders in people to help clinicians make accurate genetic diagnoses. 

I completed my Bachelor of Biomedicine (Degree with Honours) under the supervision of A/Prof David Ascher at the University of Melbourne. My honours research involved exploring the differences in mutational tolerances between different ethnic populations using large whole genome datasets and bioinformatics tools developed by the Ascher lab. I completed my undergraduate studies at the same university with a Bachelor of Science (Major in Computational Biology) in 2019.

Additionally, I am also the co-founder of TNK2, a cybersecurity research and development company based in Melbourne, Australia using the latest research & developments in machine learning, AI & behavioural science to help make people and organisations safer whilst using digital technologies.
