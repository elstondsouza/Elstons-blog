Hi! I am Elston.

I currently work at the Computational Rare Disease Genomics Lab (under A/Prof Nicky Whiffin) at the University of Oxford. 

My current research looks at estimating how evolution act on non-coding mutations (a certain kind of mutation that appears in everyone's DNA) and better understand how (and if) they lead to medical disorders in people to help clinicians make accurate genetic diagnoses. 

I completed my Bachelor of Biomedicine (Degree with Honours) and a Bachelor of Science (Major in Computational Biology) at the University of Melbourne in 2020. 

Additionally, I am also the co-founder of TNK, a cybersecurity research and development company based in Melbourne, Australia using the latest research & developments in machine learning, AI & behavioural science to help make people and organisations safer whilst using digital technologies.
