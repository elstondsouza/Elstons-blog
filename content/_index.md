I am a computational genomics researcher working with next-generation sequencing data of both human and infectious agents (including SARS-CoV-2) to improve the interpretation of various diseases & medical disorders.

I am also the co-founder of TNK2, a cybersecurity research and development company that uses the latest research in human-factors and cybersecurity to help make people & organisations safer while using digital technology.

Have a read through [blog posts](/posts/) where you can get a glimpse into what I find most interesting.
